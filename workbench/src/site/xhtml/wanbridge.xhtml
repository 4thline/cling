    <h1>
        The WAN Bridge &amp; HTTP Gateway in the Cling Workbench
    </h1>

    <p>
        The Cling Workbench features an <strong>HTTP Gateway</strong>, so you can access all your UPnP devices
        with a webbrowser, either while you are at home or even remotely. The HTTP interface is RESTful and
        utilizes XHTML, thus enabling <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HATEOAS">HATEOAS</a> and easy
        programmatic client access. (It's not "pretty" for humans.)
    </p>

    <p>
        Furthermore, the <strong>WAN Bridge</strong> maintains a durable live connection between two LANs, typically
        over a WAN. Endpoint connection management is implemented with RESTful HTTP interfaces. In other words,
        you can discover and control your friends UPnP devices over the public Internet, and they
        can discover and control yours. Devices from a remote LAN appear on your LAN and they act like they are
        connected directly on your LAN. (At this time GENA eventing is not supported and subscriptions
        to bridged remote devices will result in an error.)
    </p>

        The following screenshot shows the WAN Bridge configuration panel in the Cling Workbench with
        two connected endpoints. The local Workbench is connected to two other Workbench instances.
        In the background you see a proxy <code>MediaServer</code> device from one of the
        connected endpoints:

         style="border: 1px solid gray; display: block; margin: 0 auto;"/>

    <p>
        If available, the Workbench can create a NAT port mapping on your router and discover the
        external IP address automatically. After starting the bridge you may access the local URL with
        your webbrowser immediately, or send it to a friend who also has a running bridge. One of you will
        then create the link by entering and connecting to the other's URL. It doesn't matter who sends
        the URL and who creates the link, all UPnP devices from one LAN will be visible on the other LAN,
        respectively. Either side may disconnect the link at any time.
    </p>

    <p>
        All communication by default is in clear-text with plain HTTP, no HTTPS or other protocols. Security
        is based on an authentication key embedded in the URL and all HTTP messages between two bridge
        endpoints.
    </p>

    <h2>Starting the bridge from the command-line</h2>

    <p>
        The extra package <a href="/m2/org/fourthline/cling/cling-workbench/1.0.5/cling-workbench-1.0.5-bridge-cli.jar">
        cling-workbench-bridge-cli.jar</a> provides a command-line version of the WAN Bridge. You can start it directly
        from your shell:
    </p>

    <pre><![CDATA[java -jar cling-workbench-bridge-cli.jar \
    -h 192.168.0.123 \
    -url http://my.wan.hostname.and.port:8123 \
    -demo]]></pre>

    <p>
        The options are the LAN interface for binding the HTTP gateway (192.168.0.123) and
        the WAN-reachable hostname and port, which will be send to other endpoints for connecting.
        The optional <code>-demo</code> argument can be provided to start a demo <em>Binary Light</em> device on
        the UPnP stack that runs the bridge, this helps with testing.
    </p>

    <p>
        Security is also based on an authentication key, so you have to watch the startup log messages of the
        bridge for the generated key:
    </p>

    <pre><![CDATA[...
INFO: <<< UPnP service started successfully
INFO: Bridge configured with local URL: http://my.wan.hostname.and.port:8123/?auth=1surius3o7zuqf8qk1dp9qlc9]]></pre>

    <p>
        No port mapping on your NAT router will be created, you have to ensure that the configured WAN
        hostname and port is reachable and mapped to the LAN host (and same port) on which the HTTP gateway
        is bound. Open the local URL in your webbrowser to test this. Then access the minimal interface for
        bridge link management with <code>http://my.wan.hostname.and.port:8123/link?auth=[key]</code>.
