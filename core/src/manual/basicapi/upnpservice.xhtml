    <div class="title">Working with a UpnpService</div>
    <div class="content">

        <p>
            The <code>UpnpService</code> is an interface:
        </p>

        <div><pre class="prettyprint"><![CDATA[public interface UpnpService {

    public UpnpServiceConfiguration getConfiguration();
    public ProtocolFactory getProtocolFactory();
    public Router getRouter();

    public ControlPoint getControlPoint();
    public Registry getRegistry();

    public void shutdown();

}]]></pre></div>

        <p>
            An instance of <code>UpnpService</code> represents a running UPnP stack, including
            all network listeners, background maintenance threads, and so on. Cling Core bundles a default
            implementation which you can simply instantiate as follows:
        </p>

        <div><pre class="prettyprint"><![CDATA[UpnpService upnpService = new UpnpServiceImpl();]]></pre></div>

        <p>
            With this implementation, the local UPnP stack is ready immediately, it listens on the network for
            UPnP messages. You should call the <code>shutdown()</code> method when you no longer need the UPnP stack.
            The bundled implementation will then cut all connections with remote event listeners and also notify all
            other UPnP participants on the network that your local services are no longer available. If you do
            not shutdown your UPnP stack, remote control points might think that your services are still available
            until your earlier announcements expire.
        </p>

        <p>
            The bundled implementation offers two additional constructors:
        </p>

        <div><pre class="prettyprint"><![CDATA[UpnpService upnpService =
    new UpnpServiceImpl(RegistryListener... registryListeners);]]></pre></div>

        <p>
            This constructor accepts your custom <code>RegistryListener</code> instances, which will be activated
            immediately even before the UPnP stack listens on any network interface. This means that you can be
            notified of <em>all</em> incoming device and service registrations as soon as the network stack is ready.
            Note that this is rarely useful, you'd typically send search requests after the stack is up and running
            anyway - after adding listeners to the registry.
        </p>

        <p>
            The second constructor supports customization of the UPnP stack configuration:
        </p>

        <div><pre class="prettyprint"><![CDATA[UpnpService upnpService =
    new UpnpServiceImpl(new DefaultUpnpServiceConfiguration(8081));]]></pre></div>

        <p>
            This example configuration will change the TCP listening port of the UPnP stack to <code>8081</code>,
            the default being an ephemeral (system-selected free) port. The <code>UpnpServiceConfiguration</code>
            is also an interface, in the example above you can see how the bundled default implementation
            is instantiated.
        </p>

        <p>
            The following section explain the methods of the <code>UpnpService</code> interface and what
            they return in more detail.
        </p>

        <div class="section" id="section.BasicAPI.UpnpService.Configuration" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
            <div class="title">Customizing configuration settings</div>
            <div class="content">

                <p>
                    This is the configuration interface of the default UPnP stack in Cling Core, an instance of
                    which you have to provide when creating the <code>UpnpServiceImpl</code>:
                </p>

                <div><pre class="prettyprint"><![CDATA[public interface UpnpServiceConfiguration {

    // NETWORK
    public NetworkAddressFactory createNetworkAddressFactory();

    public DatagramProcessor getDatagramProcessor();

    public StreamClient createStreamClient();
    public MulticastReceiver createMulticastReceiver(NetworkAddressFactory naf);

    public Executor getSyncProtocolExecutor();

    // REGISTRY
    public Namespace getNamespace();
    public Executor getRegistryMaintainerExecutor();
    public Executor getRegistryListenerExecutor();

}]]></pre></div>

                <p>
                    This is quite an extensive SPI but you typically won't implement it from scratch. Overriding
                    and customizing the bundled <code>DefaultUpnpServiceConfiguration</code> should suffice in most
                    cases.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The configuration settings reflect the internal structure of Cling Core:
                </p>

                <dl>
                    <dt>Network</dt>
                    <dd>
                        <p>
                            The <code>NetworkAddressFactory</code> provides the network interfaces, ports, and
                            multicast settings which are used by the UPnP stack. At the time of writing, the following
                            interfaces and IP addresses are ignored by the default configuration: any IPv6 interfaces
                            and addresses, interfaces whose name starts with "vmnet", and the local loopback.
                            Otherwise, all interfaces and their TCP/IP addresses are used and bound.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            You can set the system property <code>org.fourthline.cling.network.useInterfaces</code> to
                            provide a comma-separated list of network interfaces you'd like to bind excusively.
                            Additionally, you can restrict the actual TCP/IP addresses to which the stack will
                            bind with a comma-separated list of IP address provided through the
                            <code>org.fourthline.cling.network.useAddresses</code> system property.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Furthermore, the configuration declares the network-level message listeners and
                            senders, that is, the implementations used by the network <code>Router</code>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Stream messages are TCP HTTP requests and responses, the bundled implementation
                            will use the Sun JDK 6.0 webserver to listen for HTTP requests, and it sends
                            HTTP requests through the standard JDK <code>HttpURLConnection</code>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            UDP unicast and multicast datagrams are received, parsed, and send by a custom
                            implementation bundled with Cling Core that does not require any particular Sun
                            JDK classes.

                        <p>
                            SOAP action and event messages are handled by configurable processors, you can provide
                            alternative implementations if necessary, see
                            <a href="#section.SwitchingXMLProcessors">Switching XML processors</a>.

                            Reading and writing UPnP XML device and service descriptors is handled by dedicated
                            binders, see <a href="#section.SwitchingXMLDescriptorBinders">Switching descriptor XML binders</a>.
                        </p>

                            The Cling UPnP stack is multi-threaded, thread creation and execution is handled
                            through <code>java.util.concurrent</code> executors. The default configuration
                            uses a pool of threads with a maximum size of 64 concurrently running threads,
                            which should suffice for even very large installations. Executors can be
                            configured fine-grained, for network message handling, actual UPnP protocol
                            execution (handling discovery, control, and event procedures), and local
                            registry maintenance and listener callback execution. Most likely you will not
                            have to customize any of these settings.
                        </p>
                    </dd>
                </dl>

                <p>
                    If you are trying to use Cling Core in a runtime container such as Tomcat, JBoss AS,
                    or Glassfish, you might run into an error on startup. The error tells you that
                    Cling couldn't use the Java JDK's <code>HTTPURLConnection</code> for HTTP
                    client operations. This is an old and badly designed part of the JDK: Only "one
                    application" in the whole JVM can configure it. If your container is already using
                    the <code>HTTPURLConnection</code>, you have to switch Cling to an alternative
                    HTTP client, e.g. the other bundled implementation based on Apache HTTP Core.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Furthermore, as mentioned earlier, Cling Core provides HTTP services using, by default,
                    the SUN JDK 6.x bundled webserver. If you are not deploying with the Sun JDK, or if you
                    also switched the HTTP client already to Apache HTTP Core, you probably also have or
                    want to switch the HTTP server.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This is how you override the default network transport configuration:
                </p>

                <div><pre class="prettyprint"><![CDATA[...

                    Don't forget to add the Apache HTTP Core libraries to your classpath or as dependencies
                    in your <code>pom.xml</code>!

                <p>
                    Cling Core internals are modular and any aspect of the UPnP protocol is handled by
                    an implementation (class) which can be replaced without affecting any other aspect.
                    The <code>ProtocolFactory</code> provides implementations, it is
                    always the first access point for the UPnP stack when a message which arrives on the
                    network or an outgoing message has to be handled:

                <p>
                    This API is a low-level interface that allows you to access the internals of the UPnP stack,
                    in the rare case you need to manually trigger a particular procedure.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The first two methods are called by the networking code when a message arrives,
                    either multicast or unicast UDP datagrams, or a TCP (HTTP) stream request. The default
                    protocol factory implementation will then pick the appropriate receiving protocol
                    implementation to handle the incoming message.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The local registry of local services known to the UPnP stack naturally also sends messages,
                    such as alive and byebye notifications. Also, if you write a UPnP control point various search,
                    control, and eventing messages are send by the local UPnP stack. The protocol factory decouples
                    the message sender (registry, control point) from the actual creation, preparation, and
                    transmission of the messages.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Transmission and reception of messages at the lowest-level is the job of the
                    network <code>Router</code>.
                </p>

            <div class="content">

                <p>
                    The reception and sending of messages, that is, all message transport, is encapsulated
                    through the <code>Router</code> interface:

                <p>
                    UPnP works with two types of messages: Multicast and unicast UDP
                    datagrams which are typically handled asynchronously, and request/response TCP messages
                    with an HTTP payload. The Cling Core bundled <code>RouterImpl</code> will
                    instantiate and maintain the listeners for incoming messages as well as transmit any
                    outgoing messages.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The actual implementation of a message receiver which listens on the network or a message
                    sender is provided by the <code>UpnpServiceConfiguration</code>, which we have introduced
                    earlier. You can access the <code>Router</code> directly if you have to execute
                    low-level operations on the network layer of the UPnP stack.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Most of the time you will however work with the <code>ControlPoint</code> and
                    <code>Registry</code> interfaces to interact with the UPnP stack.
