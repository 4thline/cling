/**
 * Supertype for all synchronously executing protocols, handling reception of UPnP messages and return a response.
 * <p>
 * After instantiation by the {@link ProtocolFactory}, this protocol <code>run()</code>s and
 * calls its own {@link #waitBeforeExecution()} method. By default, the protocol does not wait
 * before then proceeding with {@link #executeSync()}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The returned response will be available to the client of this protocol. The
 * client will then call either {@link #responseSent(org.fourthline.cling.model.message.StreamResponseMessage)}
 * or {@link #responseException(Throwable)}, depending on whether the response was successfully
 * delivered. The protocol can override these methods to decide if the whole procedure it is
 * implementing was successful or not, including not only creation but also delivery of the response.
 * </p>
 *
 * @param <IN> The type of incoming UPnP message handled by this protocol.
 * @param <OUT> The type of response UPnP message created by this protocol.
