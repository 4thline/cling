/**
 * Binds the metadata of a service to a service implementation, unified interface for accessing local services.
 * <p>
 * The UPnP core will always access a local service implementation through
 * this manager, available with {@link org.fourthline.cling.model.meta.LocalService#getManager()}:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * The {@link org.fourthline.cling.model.action.ActionExecutor}s use the manager to process
 * UPnP control invocations. It's the service manager's job to translate
 * such an action invocation into an actual method invocation, or any other procedure
 * that satisfies the requirements. The {@link org.fourthline.cling.model.action.ActionExecutor}
 * works together with the manager, for example, the
 * {@link org.fourthline.cling.model.action.MethodActionExecutor} expects that an action
 * method can be invoked through reflection on the instance returned by the manager's
 * {@link #getImplementation()} method. This is possible with the
 * the {@link org.fourthline.cling.model.DefaultServiceManager}. A different service manager
 * might require a different set of action executors, and vice versa.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * The {@link org.fourthline.cling.model.state.StateVariableAccessor}s use the manager
 * to process UPnP state variable queries and GENA eventing. It's the service manager's
 * job to return an actual value when a state variable has to be read. The
 * {@link org.fourthline.cling.model.state.StateVariableAccessor} works together with
 * the service manager, for example, the {@link org.fourthline.cling.model.state.FieldStateVariableAccessor}
 * expects that a state variable value can be read through reflection on a field, of
 * the instance returned by {@link #getImplementation()}. This is possible with the
 * {@link org.fourthline.cling.model.DefaultServiceManager}. A different service manager
 * might require a different set of state variable accessors, and vice versa.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * A service manager has to notify the UPnP core, and especially the GENA eventing system,
 * whenever the state of any evented UPnP state variable changes. For new subscriptions
 * GENA also has to read the current state of the service manually, when the subscription
 * has been established and an initial event message has to be send to the subscriber.
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * A service manager can implement these concerns in any way imaginable. It has to
 * be thread-safe.
 * </p>
 *
 * @param <T> The interface expected by the
 *            bound {@link org.fourthline.cling.model.action.ActionExecutor}s
 *            and {@link org.fourthline.cling.model.state.StateVariableAccessor}s.
