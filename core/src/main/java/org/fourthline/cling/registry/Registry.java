/**
 * The core of the UPnP stack, keeping track of known devices and resources.
 * <p>
 * A running UPnP stack has one <code>Registry</code>. Any discovered device is added
 * to this registry, as well as any exposed local device. The registry then maintains
 * these devices continuously (see {@link RegistryMaintainer}) and when needed refreshes
 * their announcements on the network or removes them when they have expired. The registry
 * also keeps track of GENA event subscriptions.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * UPnP client applications typically monitor activity of the registry
 * via {@link RegistryListener}, they are inherently asynchronous.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The registry has to be {@link #shutdown()} properly, so it can notify all participants
 * on the network that local devices will no longer be available and cancel all
 * GENA subscriptions.
 * <p>
 * An implementation has to be thread-safe.

    /**
     * Resumes background maintenance (thread) of registered items.
     * <p>
     * A local control point has to handle the following situations when resuming
     * registry maintenance:
     * <p>
     * A remote device registration might have expired. This is the case when the remote
     * device stopped sending announcements while the registry was paused (maybe because
     * the device was switched off) and the registry was paused longer than the device
     * advertisement's maximum age. The registry will not know if the device is still
     * available when it resumes maintenance. However, it will simply assume that the
     * remote device is still available and restart its expiration check cycle. That means
     * a device will finally be removed from the registry, if no further announcements
     * from the device are received, when the maximum age of the device has elapsed
     * after the registry resumed operation.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Secondly, a remote device registration might not have expired but some of your
     * outbound GENA subscriptions to its services have not been renewed within the expected renewal
     * period. Therefore your outbound subscriptions might be invalid, because the remote
     * service can drop subscriptions when you don't renew them. On resume, the registry
     * will attempt to send renewals for all outbound GENA subscriptions that require
     * renewal, on devices that still haven't expired. If renewal fails, your subscription will
     * end with {@link org.fourthline.cling.model.gena.CancelReason#RENEWAL_FAILED}. Although
     * you then might conclude that the remote device is no longer available, a GENA renewal
     * can also fail for other reasons. The remote device will be kept and maintained in the
     * registry until it announces itself or it expires, even after a failed GENA renewal.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * If you are providing local devices and services, resuming registry maintenance has
     * the following effects:
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Local devices and their services are announced again immediately if the registry
     * has been paused for longer than half of the device's maximum age. Remote control
     * points will either see this as a new device advertisement (if they have dropped
     * your device while you paused maintenance) or as a regular update if you didn't
     * pause longer than the device's maximum age/expiration timeout.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Inbound GENA subscriptions to your local services are active, even in
     * paused state - remote control points should continue renewing the subscription.
     * If a remote control point stopped renewing a subscription without unsubscribing
     * (hard power off), an outdated inbound subscription will be detected when you
     * resume maintenance. This subscription will be cleaned up immediately on resume.
     * </p>
