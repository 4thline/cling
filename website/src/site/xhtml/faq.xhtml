                Yes, you can write a control point application for Android with
                Cling Core as a UPnP library. You can find additional utilities for
                browsing and parsing a MediaServer content directory in the
                Cling Support module.

                Cling is licensed under the LGPL, so there are no restrictions on the use of the unmodified Cling JAR
                files/binaries. You can use the unmodified JAR files/binaries in any application or device, for any
                purpose. The following distribution (for free or for pay) restrictions apply:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    If you distribute Cling with your application or device, you have to include a notice like
                    "contains LGPL software" and a link to the Cling homepage, so your users also get the benefit of
                    Free Software.
                </li>
                <li>
                    You have to allow replacement of the Cling library in your distributed application. This means
                    replacement of the JAR file (e.g. in a WAR or EAR package) or replacement of Cling .class files
                    in the Android APK package (dex2jar). You can not lock your distribution package with any kind
                    of obfuscation or DRM scheme.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If you modify Cling source code, and you distribute a binary compiled from this modified source
                    code, you have to distribute your changed source code as well under the LGPL (upon request).
                    Typically this means you contribute your changes  back to the Cling project, to be included in
                    an official Cling release.

            <p>
                Cling Core is distributed as a single JAR file. It only has one other
                dependency, the <code>seamless-*</code> libraries. All JAR files are
                typically packaged next to each other in the ZIP distribution. You
                have to add these JAR files to your classpath.

                First write a control point and a <code>RegistryListener</code> as explained

                the manual</a>. Then call <code>device.getServices()</code> when a device has
                been discovered.

        <dd>
            <p>
                You'll get an error on startup, this error tells you that Cling couldn't use
                the Java JDK's <code>HTTPURLConnection</code> for HTTP client operations. This is
                an old and badly designed part of the JDK: Only "one application" in the whole
                JVM can configure it. You have to switch Cling to an alternative HTTP client,
                e.g. the other bundled implementation based on Apache HTTP Core. This is explained
                in more detail in <a href="/projects/cling/core/manual/cling-core-manual.html#section.BasicAPI.UpnpService.Configuration">
                the user manual</a>.

        <dd>
            <p>
                No, the default configuration of the UPnP stack in Cling Core will filter
                all network interfaces and IP addresses that are not IPv4. Some other parts
                of the Cling Core library might also assume that addresses are IPv4 and the
                whole library has not been tested in an IPv6 only environment. You are welcome
                to test Cling on IPv6 with a custom <code>UpnpServiceConfiguration</code> and
                <code>NetworkAddressFactory</code> and contribute back any necessary changes.

                The java.util.logging implementation on Android is broken, it does not allow you to print
                debug-level messages easily. See
